<p>As soon as people can work in parallel, someone’s going to step on someone else’s toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy. Version control helps us manage these <strong>conflicts</strong> by giving us tools to <strong>resolve</strong> overlapping changes.</p>
<p>To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file <code>mars.txt</code> currently looks like this in both local copies of our <code>planets</code> repository (the one in our home directory and the one in <code>/tmp</code>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</code></pre>
<p>Let’s add a line to the copy under our home directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to our home copy</code></pre>
<p>and then push the change to Bitbucket:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Adding a line in our home copy&quot;</span>
$ <span class="kw">hg</span> push</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>pushing to https://bitbucket.org/vlad/planets
searching for changes

added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files</code></pre>
<p>Our repositories are now in this state:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/hg-after-first-conflicting-change.svg" alt="After Making First Change" />
<p class="caption">After Making First Change</p>
</div>
<p>Now let’s switch to the copy under <code>/tmp</code> and make a different change there <em>without</em> updating from Bitbucket:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> /tmp/planets
$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the temporary copy</code></pre>
<p>We can commit the change locally:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Adding a line in the temporary copy&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>but hg won’t let us push it to Bitbucket:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> push</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>pushing to https://bitbucket.org/vlad/planets
searching for changes
abort: push creates new remote head 9f82bc5a1e80!
(merge or see &quot;hg help push&quot; for details about pushing new heads)</code></pre>
<p>Mercurial detects that our changes conflict with the changes in the remote server and stops us from creating a confusing situation in that server. What we have to do is pull the changes from Bitbucket, <strong>merge</strong> them into the copy we’re currently working in, and then push that. Let’s start by pulling:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> pull</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>pulling from https://bitbucket.org/vlad/planets

added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
(run &#39;hg heads&#39; to see heads, &#39;hg merge&#39; to merge)</code></pre>
<p><code>hg pull</code> tells us there’s an extra head and suggests that we use <code>hg heads</code> to inspect the situation and <code>hg merge</code> to resolve it. Let’s first attempt to understand the situation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> heads</code></pre></div>

<p>This shows us that our repository currently has two heads. Looking at the graph of our log with <code>hg log --graph</code> or <code>hg log -G</code> may be more informative:</p>

<p>With the graph, we can see more details at a glance. The <code>@</code> marker shows the commit we’re currently standing on, <code>5:9f82bc5a1e80</code>. We have just pulled changeset <code>6:721158ca243d</code>, which added a head to our clone, because it was also based off <code>4:2e9c23a9090d</code>. Herein lies the potential conflict, since two different changesets branched off from the same starting commit.</p>
<p>It is important to note something about revision numbers here (the <code>5</code> and the <code>6</code> before the <code>:</code>). The same commits may have different revision numbers in different clones. These revision numbers are assigned in the order that a clone acquires new commits. On the other hand, the identifiers (<code>9f82bc5a1e80</code> and <code>721158ca243d</code> in this case) uniquely identify the changeset no matter in which clone it is. When we communicate with other people, it is important to use identifiers. When we work alone, however, we may use revision numbers as a convenience that is local to a clone.</p>
<p>Let us now proceed to resolve this situation by merging the two heads. To do that we’ll use the <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"><code>kdiff3</code></a> merge tool which gives us an interface that makes it easier to understand what it happening.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> merge --tool=kdiff3</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>merging mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>It may take a few seconds for Mercurial to pass the necessary information to <code>kdiff3</code>, but soon you should see a window that looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/hg-kdiff3-conflict-windows.png" alt="Kdiff3 on Windows" />
<p class="caption">Kdiff3 on Windows</p>
</div>
<p>The pane labelled <code>base</code> refers to how this file looked like at revision <code>4</code>, where our conflicting revisions <code>5</code> and <code>6</code> are based on. Since we were standing on <code>5</code> when we started the merge, that is the pane labelled <code>local</code>. We’re attempting to merge this with revision <code>6</code>, which is labelled <code>other</code>. kdiff3 has buttons for moving from one conflict to another. In this case, there is only one conflict. At each conflict we can select either the <code>local</code> or the <code>other</code> change or to write something completely different in the result at the bottom.</p>
<p>It is now up to us to edit this file to reconcile the changes. We can do anything we want: keep the change in this branch, keep the change made in the other, write something new to replace both, or get rid of the change entirely. Let’s resolve the conflict so it looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/hg-kdiff3-conflict-windows-resolved.png" alt="Resolving on Windows" />
<p class="caption">Resolving on Windows</p>
</div>
<p>Once we’ve finished merging, let us inspect the working directory before we finalize the merge:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> summary</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>parent: 5:9f82bc5a1e80

parent: 6:721158ca243d tip
 Adding a line in our home copy
branch: default
commit: 1 modified (merge)
update: (current)</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that right now our working directory is in a merge state. We see that the working directory has two parents, and one file is about to get merged.</p>
<p>Let us look at the graph again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> log -G</code></pre></div>

<p>so we push our changes to Bitbucket:</p>

<p>This only pulled new changes into our history, but did not touch our files. After we run <code>hg update</code> to update the files to the new changes,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">hg</span> update</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</code></pre>

<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

<p>We don’t need to merge again because Bitbucket knows someone has already done that.</p>
<p>Version control’s ability to merge conflicting changes is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file. There’s another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users that they ought to clarify who’s responsible for what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.</p>
